        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10">1. üëã What is Jethosting?</h2>
        <p>
          Jethosting, launched in 2025, is built by a team of hosting industry veterans. Their mission is simple: eliminate the frustrations that small business owners,
          bloggers, and developers often face with traditional hosts.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unlike some competitors that cut corners on support or push hidden fees, Jethosting differentiates itself through:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li>Performance-first infrastructure (LiteSpeed Enterprise, NVMe SSDs, HTTP/3).</li>
          <li>Security-first design (firewalls, malware protection, DDoS defense included by default).</li>
          <li>Transparent, honest pricing (entry-level plans under $2/month with no hidden extras).</li>
          <li>Customer-first philosophy (free migrations, free domain, free SSL, and 24/7 real people support).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          It has already expanded internationally by opening a Frankfurt, Germany data center, complementing its US servers. That‚Äôs particularly important for users
          in Europe, where latency and privacy laws matter.
        </p>

        {/* Heading 2 */}
        <img

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10">2. üìà Jethosting Features That Matter</h2>
        <p>Here‚Äôs a breakdown of what you get when hosting with Jethosting:</p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">2.1 High-Performance Stack</h3>
        <p>
          - LiteSpeed Enterprise servers for faster PHP performance.<br/>
          - NVMe SSD storage that reduces database read/write times.<br/>
          - HTTP/3 protocol for quicker connections.<br/>
          - Built-in caching optimized for WordPress and WooCommerce.
        </p>

        <p>
          In fact, one case study reported a <strong>5√ó speed improvement</strong> after migrating a business site to Jethosting. 
          This is rare hard data in an industry full of vague "fast hosting" claims.

       alt=""
       />
       </div>


        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">2.2 Security Without Extra Fees</h3>
        <p>
          Every plan includes:<br/>
          - Free SSL certificates.<br/>
          - Web Application Firewall (WAF).<br/>
          - Imunify360 malware protection.<br/>
          - DDoS protection.<br/>
          - Real-time monitoring with automated patching.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unlike competitors who hide these behind add-ons, Jethosting <strong>bakes security into the base plans</strong>, saving you money and peace of mind.
        </p>


        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">2.3 Global Data Centers (USA + Europe)</h3>
        <img
          src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dpgspconw/image/upload/v1758635541/jethosting-datacenters_l2acwu.webp"
          alt="JetHosting data centers in USA and Germany for faster website hosting"
          className="rounded-lg shadow-md my-6"
        />
        <p>
        One of the top features of Jet Web Hosting which make it better than it's competitors is datacenters locations. 
        Hosting location matters because it directly affects website speed for visitors.
        </p>
        <p>
          - If your audience is in the US, choose the American data center.<br/>
          - If your audience is in Europe, choose Frankfurt for reduced latency.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">2.4 Free Expert Migrations & Ease of Use</h3>
        <p>
        Migrating a website can be a headache for many users because migration involves some technical knowledge depending on the type of website. 
        In fact, many web hosting charge $25‚Äì$50 per site from users. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The good point is Jethosting does it <strong>completely free</strong>, covering unlimited sites and
        email accounts, with zero downtime. Combined with cPanel access, WP-CLI, Git integration, and one-click installs, it balances beginner-friendliness with developer control.
        </p>


        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">2.5 Transparent Pricing</h3>
        <p>
        While price is a key consideration in selecting a web hosting plan, many established providers advertise low introductory prices but hide the significantly higher renewal fees. 
        </p>
        <p>Jet Hosting offers complete transparency in its pricing structure. To ensure customer satisfaction, all plans include a 60-day money-back guarantee. Here‚Äôs how they stack:
        </p>

        />


        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-10">3. üîç Real-World Performance & Customer Feedback</h2>
        <p>
          While lab benchmarks are useful, what really matters is how customers experience the service.
        </p>
