        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6">Is InterServer a Good Web Host? A 9-Month, Data-Driven Review</h2>
        <p>
          For the past nine months, I've been running a rigorous test on InterServer's web hosting. 
          I purchased their $2/month plan, meticulously tracked performance, ran speed tests, 
          and even compared it to a dozen other providers.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, it's time to answer the question: <strong>Is InterServer a good choice to host your website?</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          After nearly a year of data collection, I have a lot to say. Let's dive into the details.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6">First Impressions: A Clunky, Confusing Interface</h2>

        <section className="relative w-full aspect-[16/9] md:aspect-[21/9]">
          <img
            src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dpgspconw/image/upload/v1759154338/trap-of-free-builders_ksuu2h.avif"
            alt="InterServer control panel interface - functional but confusing for beginners"
            className="w-full h-full object-cover opacity-70"
          />
        </section>

        <p>
          Let's start with the biggest drawback: <strong>the user interface.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe the worst thing about InterServer is its control panel. It's confusing, 
          especially for a first time website owner. For example, even though I only purchased 
          web hosting, my dashboard actively displays every single service InterServer offers  
          twice with most sections being completely empty.
        </p>

        <p>
          To actually work on my website, I had to click one of the smallest buttons on the 
          screen to access the real control panel. This is where you can install WordPress, 
          create email accounts, and set up backups the important stuff.
        </p>

        <p>
          The entire experience feels like it was built by an engineer, not a designer. 
          InterServer seems to operate on a mentality of "it needs to work well, not look good," 
          sacrificing ease of use and aesthetics for raw functionality.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">The Silver Lining: It's Snappy and Functional</h3>
        <p>
          And you know what? That mentality pays off. The interface is incredibly snappy. 
          There's no lag or excessive loading screens. You'll likely only use a handful of 
          buttons before forgetting the interface exists altogether. After the initial setup, 
          it becomes smooth sailing.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6">Setting Up a Website: A Straightforward Process</h2>
        <p>
          Creating my test website was simple using InterServer's automatic WordPress installer. 
          I just needed to create my login details and press install. No problems here.
        </p>

        <p>
          Of course, the default WordPress installation looks well, like a default WordPress site. 
          To create a realistic test, I downloaded a pre made template from Envato Elements. 
          I chose this method because most people build sites this way, and these templates are 
          often poorly optimized with excess code providing a true test of performance, not just an ideal scenario.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6">Performance Deep Dive: Where the $2.50 Plan Shows Its Limits</h2>
        
        <section className="relative w-full aspect-[16/9] md:aspect-[21/9]">
          <img
            src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dpgspconw/image/upload/v1759154338/expensive-web-hostings_qugtwz.avif"
            alt="InterServer performance testing with WP Benchmark - database limitations revealed"
            className="w-full h-full object-cover opacity-70"
          />
        </section>

        <p>
          Once the design was loaded, I used the WP Benchmark plugin to test the server's performance. 
          This is where the holes in the budget plan began to show.
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li>✅ <strong>CPU & Memory:</strong> Good</li>
          <li>✅ <strong>File System:</strong> Great</li>
          <li>❌ <strong>Database Score:</strong> Pretty bad</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          After running the test three times, it was clear this server struggles with complex or 
          large amounts of data uploaded in a short period, though it handles simple queries extremely well.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4">The Reason: Process Limits</h3>
        <p>
          This makes perfect sense. InterServer's standard plans are limited to <strong>30 processes per second.</strong> 
          Think of it like trying to squeeze 31 people through a door at once—it just doesn't work. 
          You need a larger door.
        </p>

        <p>
          That said, 30 is still generous. Other cheap hosts like Hostinger offer only 10, 
          and Bluehost doesn't even disclose their limit (which is rarely a good sign).
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6">Real-World Speed Test: How Does It Compare?</h2>
        <p>
          Theory is one thing; real-world performance is another. I cloned my website onto 
          Bluehost and Hostinger's premium plans and recorded the loading times in an incognito window.
        </p>

        <p><strong>The result?</strong> Bluehost was dead last, and InterServer came out first.</p>

        <p>
          To understand why, I used GT Metrics. Here's the breakdown:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li><strong>InterServer Fully Loaded:</strong> 1.2 seconds</li>
          <li><strong>Bluehost Fully Loaded:</strong> Almost 4 times slower</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The key is the <strong>"Snowball Effect"</strong> of website loading. The first metric, 
          Time to First Byte (TTFB), is crucial. InterServer's TTFB was 150ms, while Bluehost's was 400ms. 
          That 250ms difference might seem small, but it cascades, slowing down every subsequent element that needs to load.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6">The Verdict: Who Is This Plan For?</h2>

        {/* Replace manual pros/cons tables with ProsConsCard component */}
        <Proscons
          pros={pros}
          cons={cons}
          title="InterServer Web Hosting: Pros and Cons"
        />

        <HostInfoBox 
          bestFor="Bloggers, small business sites, and portfolios on a tight budget."
          rating="⭐ 6.9 / 10"
          link="https://www.interserver.net/r/999999" // Replace with actual affiliate link
        />

        <p><strong>My Recommendation:</strong></p>
        <p>
          I would <strong>NOT</strong> host a complex e-commerce store on this $2.50 plan, 
          where users are constantly performing actions and interacting with the database. 
          However, for blogs, small business brochure sites, and portfolios, it offers incredible value.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Performance Score: 6.9/10</strong> — which is pretty incredible for just $2.50.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you plan on running an e-commerce site or expect high traffic, check out 
          InterServer's <strong>Boost 2 and Boost 4 plans</strong>, which scale resources very effectively.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6">InterServer Pricing: The Catch</h2>
        <p>
          Like many web hosts, InterServer uses introductory pricing.
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li><strong>First Term:</strong> Discounted price (e.g., $2.50/month)</li>
          <li><strong>Upon Renewal:</strong> Price increases to the standard rate of ~$7/month</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The best deal is to lock in a two-year plan. You can also use our link with the code 
          <strong> BrandoraLab</strong> to get your <strong>first month for just one cent</strong>, 
          bringing the total for two years to around $57. You can deactivate the add-ons during 
          checkout to save even more cash.
        </p>

        <p>
          For a temporary project, the one-month plan for $2.50 is a fantastic, no-commitment option.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6">Final Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          After nine months and spending roughly $20, I can confidently say this was some of 
          the best money I've spent on web hosting. The performance and uptime are exceptional for the price.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>I highly recommend you check out InterServer</strong> if you're looking for 
          reliable, high-value hosting for a standard website.
